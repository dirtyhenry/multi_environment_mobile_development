Multi Environment Mobile Development
====================================

These are the slides I made for a talk about mobile development in november 2012 in a French engineering school ENSEIRB-Matmeca.

I'm trying to maintain them since cause I felt it was a good reference to keep numbers in mind for both developers and decision makers.

Feel free to contribute or fork these slides for your own talks.

These slides are available online on [Bootstragram][1]
